The pins package helps you publish data sets, models, and other Python objects, making it easy to share them across projects and with your colleagues.
You can pin objects to a variety of "boards", including local folders (to share on a networked drive or with DropBox), Posit Connect, Amazon S3,
Google Cloud Storage, Azure, and more.
This vignette will introduce you to the basics of pins.
